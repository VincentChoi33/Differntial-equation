# ODE is unknown function which has only one variable.

we divided each DE with two criterion

*order* and *linearity*

*order* is 최고계 도함수의 계

*lnearity* has two property 
1. the order of indepent variable y and all y's derivative is one
2. each coefficient only depends on independent variable x

Other equations are nonlinear equation


Not every ODE has solutions.

When the ODE has solutions,
-If the ODE has initial condition, this solution is called *particular solution*
-If the ODE doen't have initial condition, this solution is called *general solution*
