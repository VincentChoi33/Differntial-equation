## What is a Differential equation

In the real world, mathmatician build model to treat natural and social situation.
This process is told "modeling"

In this process, mathmatical model might be represented equiation as derivative of Unknown function.

There are many kinds of Models 

So let's study DE(differential equation


DE has two branches

The first one is Ordinary differential equation

When the unknown function(DE) has one variable

We call it as ODE


The other one is Partial differential equation

When the unknown function(DE) has two or more variables

We call it as PDE
